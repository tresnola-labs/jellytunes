JellyTunes is a desktop app for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) users who want to take their music offline. Browse your server's artists, albums, and playlists, pick a destination — a USB drive, SD card, or any local folder — and hit sync. JellyTunes downloads everything, converts formats if needed, and mirrors your server's folder structure at the destination.

## Key Features

- **Browse your full library** — artists, albums, and playlists pulled directly from your Jellyfin server
- **Sync anywhere** — USB drives, SD cards, and local folders all work as destinations
- **Selective sync** — only downloads what's new or changed; skips tracks already at the destination
- **Out-of-sync detection** — tracks that changed on the server since the last sync are automatically flagged for update
- **Sync preview** — review exactly what will be added, updated, or removed before you commit to a sync
- **FLAC to MP3 conversion** — built-in FFmpeg support with configurable bitrate (128k / 192k / 320k); settings saved per device
- **Smart storage bar** — visual capacity indicator with live size estimates; warns when your selection exceeds free space
- **Smart filesystem handling** — auto-detects FAT32, exFAT, and NTFS; sanitizes filenames accordingly
- **Per-destination history** — remembers what was synced to each device or folder so you can pick up where you left off
- **Cancel anytime** — stop a sync mid-progress without corrupting what's already been written

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/oriaflow-labs/jellytunes/releases):

| Platform | File |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `.dmg` |
| Windows | `.exe` installer |
| Linux | `.AppImage` or `.deb` |

Open the installer and follow the prompts. No additional setup is required — FFmpeg is bundled with the app.

### macOS: "App is damaged" or Gatekeeper warning

JellyTunes is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate. macOS may block it on first launch, especially on macOS 15 (Sequoia). To open it:

**Option A — via Terminal (recommended):**
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/JellyTunes.app
```
Then open the app normally.

**Option B — via System Settings:**
1. Try to open the app (it will be blocked)
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Security**
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the JellyTunes entry

### Prerequisites

- A [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) server reachable on your network
- A USB drive, SD card, local folder, or any mounted storage device as destination

## Development

Everything below is for contributors and developers who want to build JellyTunes from source.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oriaflow-labs/jellytunes.git
cd jellytunes
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and launches the Electron window.

**Requirements**: Node.js 18+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

### Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start dev server + Electron
pnpm build            # Compile with electron-vite
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript type checking

# Testing
pnpm test             # Unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm test:unit:watch  # Unit tests in watch mode
pnpm test:bdd         # BDD tests headless (Cucumber + Playwright)
pnpm test:bdd:dev     # BDD tests with visible UI

# Packaging
pnpm package          # Build + create installers
```

### Architecture

Three Electron processes plus a standalone sync engine:

- **Main process** (`src/main/`) — IPC handlers, USB/filesystem detection, sync orchestration
- **Preload** (`src/preload/`) — typed IPC bridge between main and renderer
- **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) — React UI for library navigation, device selection, and sync progress
- **Sync module** (`src/sync/`) — dependency-injected sync engine (API client, file ops, FFmpeg converter); fully unit-testable without hitting the network or filesystem
